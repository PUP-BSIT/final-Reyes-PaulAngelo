      <div>
        5 years from now... 5 years from now I want to be a professional in the
        IT industry. Even it is hard, I want to continue this path. When I
        enrolled in this subject I saw the glimpse of the real world, how big 
        the world is. In the class, sometimes I passed the exercise and 
        sometimes I don't. I realize that there's a lot I don't know, 
        especially the JavaScript, which I had a hard time learning. 
        Is it worth it? I think so, the pressure I've got in the class when 
        we first met you. Overall, this class taught me how to handle time 
        pressure activities, how to properly collaborate with my teammates and 
        our seniors, and especially the insight on how the real world works.
