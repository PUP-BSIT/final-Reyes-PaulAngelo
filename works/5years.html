        <p>
          5 years from now... 5 years from now I want to be a professional in
          the IT industry. Even it is hard, I want to continue this path. When
          Ienrolled in this subject I saw the glimpse of the real world, how 
          big the world is. In the class, sometimes I passed the exercise and
          sometimes I don't. I realize that there's a lot I don't know,
          especially the JavaScript, which I had a hard time learning. Is it
          worth it? I think so, the pressure I've got in the class when we
          firstmet you. Overall, this class taught me how to handle time
          pressureactivities, how to properly collaborate with my teammates and
          our seniors, and especially the insight on how the real world works.
        </p>
        <p>
          So In 5 years I want to utilize the knowledge I acquired during my
          study. Not only in the field of programming but ofcouse in different
          field like Hardware, Networking, Business, and many more. I choose to
          fight even though I know that it is my weakness so that I can improve
          myself. So before this 5 years I will continuous improve my self
          because it is not only for me but to ensure that my family can live
          there life in the fulliest.
