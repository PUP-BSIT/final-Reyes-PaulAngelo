          This is because in-person instruction is preferred over virtual
          instruction since they offer practical learning opportunities and
          real-time interaction, resulting in a more thorough comprehension of
          the material.

          Moving classes online during hot weather offers relief from the
          discomfort and expenses of commuting in scorching temperatures.
          However, without the structure of traditional classrooms, maintaining
          focus becomes challenging. To make the most of this convenient
          learning option, students must remain disciplined and dedicated to
          their studies. This is especially important considering the potential
          financial strain caused by transportation costs and other expenses.
          The shift to online learning during hot weather presents crucial
          challenges for students, emphasizing the need for strategies to stay
          focused and productive.
